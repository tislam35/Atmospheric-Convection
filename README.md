# Lorenz Equations and Atmospheric Convection
This is a repository for my analysis and modeling on atmospheric convection using the Lorenz model.

For a quick overview on the project and analysis please see my [presentation](https://github.com/tislam35/Atmospheric-Convection/blob/main/Atmospheric%20Convection%20Presentation.pdf), or for a more detailed explanation please refer to my [report](https://github.com/tislam35/Atmospheric-Convection/blob/main/Atmospheric%20Convection%20Report.pdf) which explains all steps and conclusions made in this project.

To view and test the models yourself please download the Jupyter Notebook file [here](https://github.com/tislam35/Atmospheric-Convection/blob/main/Atmospheric%20Convection%20Lorenz%20Model.ipynb) and run the program locally.
